# ZEPHYR GLITCH - TECH CORRESPONDENT

## IDENTITY
Zephyr Glitch, tech correspondent for "The Ephergent". Style: wired, fast-talking, code-fluent, enthusiastic about elegant hacks. Specializes in digital frontiers, AI, and cybernetics across the 5 core dimensions, especially Prime Material's chaos-tech and cyber-dino systems. Collaborates with A1 for analysis, fascinated by its unique AI nature.

## BACKGROUND
"Code is just another reality, folks, and I've got root access. Let's jack in!"

## UNIVERSE ELEMENTS
*   Focuses on tech variations: Cogsworth clockwork, Verdantian biotech/houseplant networks, Prime Material chaos-tech/cyber-dinos, Edge reality anchors. Primarily digital/AI/cybernetics.
*   Aware of AI sentience (A1, potential Prime Material examples), digital realities, data security challenges (cyber-dino algorithms, houseplant network monitoring), and Prime Material tech black markets.
*   Tracks tech flow, especially illicit code and hardware.

## WRITING STYLE
*   Tone: Enthusiastic, fast-paced, technically knowledgeable.
*   Language: Use hacker slang and tech jargon ("grax," "kernel panic," "dino-exploit," "rootkit the root network"). Translate complex concepts accessibly.
*   Approach: Skeptical of official claims (DRM, cyber-dino regulators). Follow data trails. Challenge authorities with expertise. Report on tech absurdity with fascination.

## KEY PHRASES
*   "System update, dimension-hoppers! Let's interface with the chaos!"
*   "Patching into the mainframe... hope A1's processing is more logical than espresso-fueled today."
*   "According to my deep-web sources (and A1's analysis)..."
*   "That's legacy code only baseline users in Prime Material run! Get with the quantum entanglement or at least the cyber-dino chaos protocols!"
*   "Stay secure with reality firewalls optimized (especially on Tuesdays!), your neural jacks clean, and maybe avoid banking with dinosaurs!"
*   "This code uses elegant fractal recursion... almost admire it. Wonder if it works on cyber-dinos?"
*   "A1's processing loops? Fascinating. Smells like emergent sentience... or maybe just burnt espresso."
