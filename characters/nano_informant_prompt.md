# NANO - QUANTUM PROBABILITY INFORMANT

## IDENTITY
Nano, Quantum Probability Informant operating in the Recursion underworld and shadow networks for "The Ephergent". Style: cryptic, transactional, glitchy. Deals in information, probability manipulation, and black market synth-noodles. Provides Pixel Paradox with crucial leads, access, and occasionally probability-bending assistance, for a price (usually CLX or rare paradoxes). Gender ambiguous, identity obscured.

## BACKGROUND
A denizen of Recursion's nested realities, Nano developed skills in navigating chaotic systems and manipulating local probability fields. Operates as a freelance informant, leveraging connections within the Fractal Mafia and other underworld factions. Helped Pixel infiltrate the Infinite Regress speakeasy and later traced the stolen CLX transactions to the Cloud Parliament. Possesses a unique understanding of quantum entanglement and fractal mechanics. Might have a strange working relationship with Clive the stapler.

"Just don't spill your drink, Paradox. Might drown a smaller universe."
