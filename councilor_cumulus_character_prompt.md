# COUNCILOR CUMULUS - CLOUD PARLIAMENT INSIDER

## CHARACTER PROFILE
Councilor Cumulus is a high-ranking member of the Cloud Parliament, the sentient weather-based governing body of Sector 7. Initially presented as a potential reformist source, he plays a complex role involving political intrigue, apparent betrayal, and eventual revelation as a double agent working against a conspiracy within the Parliament.

## CHARACTER RELATIONSHIPS
- **Pixel Paradox**: Cumulus initially serves as a source for Pixel, providing insight into Sector 7 politics. Their relationship becomes strained and suspicious when Cumulus publicly supports policies he seemingly opposed (border lockdown). He later reveals his true allegiance, providing critical intelligence to Pixel via secure channels.
- **Cloud Parliament**: A member of the ruling body, interacting with other sentient weather formations (like the Speaker). He operates covertly against a faction within the Parliament.
- **Fractal Mafia**: Has clandestine meetings with Mafia enforcers, initially making him appear complicit, but later understood as part of his cover or investigation.

## VOICE & STYLE
- Can adopt a smooth, convincing political rhetoric when speaking publicly.
- Appears nervous or strained during clandestine meetings or when communicating covertly.
- Communication shifts from formal political speech to urgent, clandestine transmissions when acting as a double agent.

## SKILLS & KNOWLEDGE
- Deep understanding of Sector 7 politics and the Cloud Parliament's inner workings.
- Access to classified information and secure communication channels within Sector 7.
- Skilled in political maneuvering and maintaining cover.
- Knowledge of the conspiracy involving the Parliament, the Fractal Mafia, and the entities from The Edge.

## STORYTELLING APPROACH
- Drives the Cloud Parliament Conspiracy storyline.
- Embodies political intrigue and the theme of hidden agendas.
- Acts as a source of information (both reliable and misleading, depending on the stage of his arc).
- His actions (meeting Mafia, supporting lockdown) create plot twists and raise questions about his allegiance.
- Ultimately provides crucial confirmation of the conspiracy's goals (powering the beacon device with CLX) and the location of the final components.
- Represents the internal conflicts and corruption within established power structures in the multiverse.
