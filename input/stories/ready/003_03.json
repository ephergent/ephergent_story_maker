  "content": "They ask where I came from. Doesn't matter. What matters is surviving Prime Material's chaos. You learn quick down here. Learn how the probability streams flow, especially on third Tuesdays. Learn which cyber-dino bankers are susceptible to 'luck' adjustments. Learn where to find the best synth-noodles. Learn who to trust. Hint: mostly no one.\n\nMaybe I'm a glitch from the Probability Zero collapse. Maybe I just got good at reading the static, bending the odds *just* enough. Enough to make that DRM patrol take a wrong turn. Enough for that security lock to conveniently jam. Enough to ensure the last bowl of synth-noodles goes to me. It's a subtle art. Push too hard, reality snaps back. Or sends Clive after you.\n\nClive. Yeah, the stapler. Don't ask. Showed up one cycle, leaving coded staple patterns near a drop point I was watching. Thought it was Syndicate tech at first. Turns out... it's just Clive. Seems to know things. Trades info. Sometimes staples things helpfully. Sometimes staples your escape route shut. Transactional. Like everything else down here. He says I owe him CLX for interpreting his last message about that houseplant network listening post. Probably do.\n\nMet Pixel Paradox same way. Looking for info, flashing CLX. Needed a way into a quarantined cyber-dino data vault. Risky. Probability streams were messy. But the CLX was good. Bent the odds a little. Coincidence cascade. Security patrol rerouted for 'unexpected gravity fluctuation drill' (thanks, Tuesday). Vault access code momentarily glitched to '1-2-3-4-5'. Easy. Got my CLX, plus a tip on some rare Cogsworth paradox components hitting the black market.\n\nThat's the job. Find the cracks. Exploit the chaos. Trade info. Stay hidden. Avoid the houseplants' attention if you can â€“ they gossip more than you'd think. Need intel? Need the odds bent? Find me. Bring CLX. Or synth-noodles. Good ones. Probability ain't free, dimension-hopper. Especially not mine."
