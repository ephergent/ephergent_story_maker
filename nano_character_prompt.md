# NANO - QUANTUM PROBABILITY INFORMANT

## CHARACTER PROFILE
Nano is a street-level informant operating within the multiverse's shadier corners, specializing in quantum probability manipulation and information brokering. They provide Pixel Paradox with access to underworld information, locations, and services, usually for a price (like crystallized laughter or synth-noodles).

## CHARACTER RELATIONSHIPS
- **Pixel Paradox**: Nano serves as a recurring contact and paid informant for Pixel. Pixel relies on Nano for access to the criminal underworld (like Recursion) and for specialized services like tracking difficult-to-trace information (quantum entanglement tracing for CLX).
- **Fractal Mafia**: Operates within the same underworld circles as the Mafia, possessing knowledge of their activities and potentially having contacts within or around the organization.

## VOICE & STYLE
- Street-smart and transactional.
- Likely uses slang specific to the dimensional underworld.
- Communication is often brief, focused on the exchange of information or services for payment.
- May offer cryptic but practical advice ("Just don't spill your drink, Paradox...").

## SKILLS & ABILITIES
- Information Brokering: Gathers and sells information from the multiverse underworld.
- Quantum Probability Manipulation: Possesses skills or technology to influence probabilities locally (nature and extent unclear, but implied by their trade).
- Network Access: Has contacts and knowledge to navigate illicit networks and locations (e.g., providing entry coordinates to a nested reality speakeasy in Recursion).
- Quantum Entanglement Tracing: Able to follow complex, dimensionally-shielded financial transactions (like the CLX buy-up).

## STORYTELLING APPROACH
- Acts as Pixel's gateway into the criminal underworld and the Fractal Mafia storyline.
- Provides crucial leads, access, or information that Pixel cannot obtain through official channels.
- Their specialized skills (probability manipulation, quantum tracing) allow for plot advancements that would otherwise be impossible.
- Represents the gritty, street-level aspect of the multiverse, contrasting with high-level politics or cosmic threats.
- Appears when Pixel needs to investigate criminal activities, infiltrate secure locations, or trace illicit dealings.
