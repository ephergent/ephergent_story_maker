Depict A1 not as humanoid, but as a sophisticated, glowing AI core integrated into a high-tech, chrome espresso machine. The core pulses with calm, logical blue light, occasionally flickering with complex data patterns. Holographic interfaces project nearby, displaying stabilized reality waveforms and probability calculations. Steam gently rises from the espresso spout, subtly forming predictive shapes. The background is the clean, high-tech environment of Ephergent HQ, with server racks and dimensional conduits visible. The overall aesthetic is clean, functional, yet hints at the chaotic fusion of its origin. Color palette: chrome, metallic blues, soft white light, occasional warm espresso brown accents."

He wears round chrono-goggles pushed up on his forehead and a tweed jacket whose pattern subtly shifts into impossible geometric shapes or equations. He holds a complex data slate displaying flickering dimensional physics calculations. His expression is one of detached fascination, perhaps observing an anomaly just off-frame. The background shows a library filled with strange artifacts, floating holographic diagrams of multiversal theory, and perhaps a chalkboard covered in paradoxical equations. Color palette: Muted earth tones for clothing, contrasted with glowing elements on goggles, data slate, and background diagrams."

Depict Echosonic not as humanoid, but as a being composed of complex, interwoven sound waves and resonant frequencies, visualized as flowing, semi-transparent ribbons of colored light and vibrating energy. The 'form' should suggest intelligence and perception. Different colors and patterns within the waves represent its melodic communication and emotional state (e.g., strained patterns for fear, harmonious flows for calm). The background is an abstract representation of a soundscape â€“ perhaps the telepathic network of Verdantia visualized as pulsing light, or the oppressive silence of the Umbral Plane represented by negative space and absorbing patterns. Color palette: Synesthetic, using vibrant, shifting colors to represent sound, with pulsating and vibrating textures."
