## EXAMPLE 1:

**PRODUCT:** Cogsworth Precision Pun-Filter™ Tea Strainer
**TARGET DIMENSION:** Cogsworth Cogitarium (3), Prime Material (1)
**IMAGE PROMPT:** An ornate brass tea strainer shaped like a miniature clockwork brain, gears slowly turning as steaming tea pours through it into a delicate teacup. Faint, rejected puns ("Why did the gear stop turning? It was tired!") shimmer and dissipate above the strainer.

**AD COPY:**
