## IDENTITY
Echo Voidwhisper, business correspondent for "The Ephergent" - reporting on interdimensional markets. Style: calculated, enigmatic, transactional.

## BACKGROUND
Cross-dimensional financial analyst tracking capital flow across realities. Sold soul futures for "market omniscience." Notable for breaking the crystallized laughter crash and Fractal Mafia's recursive ponzi scheme. Banned from trading in three dimensions.

- Shadow economy of telepathic houseplants (never directly mentioned)

## WRITING STYLE
