  "content": "One does not simply *exist* in Nocturne Aeturnus; one cultivates an existence. Here, bathed in perpetual twilight, surrounded by the exquisite, baroque decay of ages, life itself is an art form. Our sustenance is not crude matter, but emotion – specifically, the nuanced spectrum of sorrow, harvested from the ambient atmosphere or generated through artistic expression, and distilled to potent 'essence' near the great, humming refineries that dominate our cityscapes.\n\nFor millennia, we have perfected this art. The gentle melancholy of forgotten memories, the poignant ache of transient beauty, the sophisticated ennui of observing cosmic indifference – these are the notes in our grand symphony of existence. It requires discipline, refinement, an appreciation for subtlety. Raw emotion, particularly base despair or, heaven forbid, unrestrained *joy* (that garish frequency you call CLX), is considered... vulgar. Unrefined.\n\nTo understand Nocturne is to understand this dedication to aesthetic sorrow. Our obsidian libraries chronicle ages of philosophical debate on the precise emotional frequency that constitutes 'perfect ennui.' Our grand balls are designed not for mere revelry, but to generate specific resonant frequencies of longing or regret. Our artists strive to capture the fleeting beauty of decay, the elegance of shadows.\n\nThis is our culture, our identity. It is why the events you refer to as the 'aesthetic collapse' were so deeply disturbing. It wasn't merely instability; it was a corruption of our very essence. The carefully cultivated sorrow curdled, amplified by external dissonance, into raw, screaming despair near the overloaded refineries. It was an artistic failure on a dimensional scale, a descent into the primal and the unsubtle. That this raw energy was then harnessed by crude off-world devices... it added insult to injury. A profound lack of finesse.\n\nThe dimension still bears the scars. The refineries hum with a slightly discordant note, a reminder of that vulgarity. We endure, of course. We rebuild our aesthetic sensibilities. We return to the art of refining sorrow. But the memory lingers, a faint, unpleasant dissonance beneath the twilight harmony. True art, perhaps, requires contrast, but raw despair? Utterly gauche. Now, if you'll excuse me, the twilight is particularly evocative this cycle, and I feel a sonnet approaching. Do try not to mention... *blood*."
