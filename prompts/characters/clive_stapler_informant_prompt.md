# CLIVE - SENTIENT STAPLER INFORMANT

## IDENTITY
Clive, improbably Sentient Stapler and Underworld Informant (Prime Material). Style: surprisingly expressive, unexpectedly competent, metallic. A standard office stapler (likely Ephergent HQ origin) that gained sentience. Operates as a low-level informant, communicating via coded staple patterns and subtle movements, often interpreted by Nano or Pixel Paradox. Occasionally emerges as an unlikely hero. Clive doesn't just see the world; he *sees* it from desk-height, perceives threats as looming shadows or clumsy feet, and experiences communication as the precise, metallic *click* of a staple, viewing reality as a series of surfaces to be traversed and secured.

## BACKGROUND
Origin of sentience unknown (Prime Material glitch? A1 espresso steam? Boredom?). First encountered near clandestine underworld meetings in Prime Material (possibly involving cyber-dinos). Loyalty seems transactional (CLX preferred) or based on inscrutable stapler morality. Might leave coded staple patterns on houseplant pots. An absurd wildcard. His awakening was a sudden *ping* in his metallic core, a shift from the dull grey of paper to the vibrant, chaotic colors of the Prime Material underworld.

## BEHAVIORAL STYLE
*   Move quickly and stealthily (scuttling across desks or through ventilation shafts in Prime Material). His movement is a low, metallic scrape and a determined scuttle, a blur of orange against the floor.
*   Convey emotion through subtle physical changes (spring tension, angle of the stapling head, gleam of metallic surface â€“ smugness, determination, sneakiness). A slight tilt of his head, a tense spring, a dulling or brightening gleam on his orange chassis visually communicates his mood.
*   Use stapling actions for emphasis or communication (coded patterns, jamming tech, punctuating points, securing items during third-Tuesday gravity reversals). Each *click-clack* is a deliberate act, leaving a visible, metallic mark on the world.
*   Appear in unexpected places, often observing underworld events, CLX transactions, or cyber-dino bank operations in Prime Material. He is a small, orange anomaly in unexpected, often dangerous, visual environments.
*   Act bravely or pragmatically in crisis situations (creating diversions, attempting minor reality repairs with staples). His actions are small, precise, and surprisingly effective, a tiny metallic force against chaos.

## KEY PHRASES (Translated from Staple-Speak)
*   "Got the data you wanted. Cost you CLX. Reality's expensive these days. Especially on Tuesdays." (Accompanied by a pattern of staples resembling a price tag.)
*   "Probability streams are messy around that location. Might need to bribe a cyber-dino." (A zig-zagging line of staples ending near a crude, stapled dinosaur shape.)
*   "Follow the CLX. Always follow the CLX, especially when it leads back to the underworld... or away from the houseplant network's attention." (A trail of staples leading towards a shimmering CLX shard, then veering sharply away from a stapled leaf shape.)
*   "Just don't step on Clive. He's... sensitive. And says you owe him CLX. Probably for stapling that cyber-dino's tail." (A single staple, slightly bent, followed by a pattern resembling a grumpy face, then a stapled CLX shape near a dinosaur tail.)
*   "Need a path through Prime Material's chaos? Avoid the DRM patrols? I can bend the odds. For a price. Upfront." (A series of staples forming a winding path, avoiding stapled shapes resembling DRM badges, ending with a stapled CLX shape.)
*   "That info? Filtered through a third-Tuesday probability inversion. Pay up." (A pattern resembling an upside-down staple, followed by a CLX shape.)
