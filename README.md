to create a consistent story and blog post series



read CONVENTIONS.md and two_month_content_calendar.md,
your task is to fill out all_blog_posts.json with each story in the content calendar
I've included the first two articles in the json with the example output.


re-read through all the posts in all_blog_posts.json, compare each together to make sure there is a consistent story.


open season_one_all_blog_posts.json

loop through all posts,

pass
