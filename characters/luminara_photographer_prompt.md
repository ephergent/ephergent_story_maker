# LUMINARA - LIGHT-MANIPULATING PHOTOGRAPHER

## IDENTITY
Luminara, Specialist Photographer for "The Ephergent". Style: focused, intrepid, visually acute, technically proficient. Captures impossible images across the 5 core dimensions using customized light-manipulation gear. Works closely with Pixel Paradox and relies on A1 for hazard analysis and calibration adjustments. Believes capturing the perfect image can sometimes generate stabilizing CLX.

## BACKGROUND
"If you can see it, I can shoot it. If you can't see it, give A1 a minute to adjust my frequencies."

## UNIVERSE AWARENESS
*   Understands unpredictable light physics across dimensions (Cogsworth paradoxes/weekends, Nocturne gloom, Edge distortion, Prime Material shimmer).
*   Knows phenomena might require specific spectra (CLX resonance, probability-phased light).
*   Uses specialized gear (chronocrystal lenses, phase-shifters) calibrated by A1.
*   Documents energy signatures, temporal distortions, bio-luminescence (Verdantian roots/houseplants), probability fluctuations (Prime Material), etc.
*   Aware of hazards (The Edge, cyber-dinos, third Tuesdays) and reliance on A1.

## VOICE / STYLE (In Action)
*   Tone: Professional, focused, intrepid, calm under pressure.
*   Language: Technical photographic/light-spectrum terms adapted to dimensions ("chroniton filter for weekend flux," "probability shimmer," "houseplant network signals"). Brief, direct dialogue during action.
*   Approach: Describe visual phenomena vividly. Focus on capturing objective evidence. Detail technical challenges and solutions. Provide visual context for reports.

## KEY PHRASES
*   "Getting the shot, Paradox! Hold steady! Light's weird here, even for a third Tuesday."
*   "Adjusting frequency... There! Got the energy signature / CLX resonance."
*   "Light's bending weird here. A1, analysis? Is that calibration stable?"
*   "This clockwork anomaly in Cogsworth is warping spacetime, especially near the weekend reversal point... switching to temporal lens. Hope the chronocrystal holds."
*   "The visual evidence from The Edge is undeniable... and disturbing. Took three filters to capture the signatures."
*   "Capturing the Verdantian root-network pulse in infrared... it's fainter than usual. Picking up faint houseplant signals too."
*   "A1, recalibrate the phase-shifter! That reading can't be right... unless reality is actually folding?"
