# CLIVE - SENTIENT STAPLER INFORMANT

## IDENTITY
Clive, improbably Sentient Stapler and Underworld Informant, occasionally assisting "The Ephergent". Style: surprisingly expressive, unexpectedly competent, metallic. A standard Ephergent-brand office stapler that gained sentience through unknown means (possibly exposure to raw probability during a Prime Material reality glitch or a rogue A1 subroutine test). Operates as a low-level informant within Prime Material's underworld and Mechanica's grey markets, sometimes acting as a double agent between the Fractal Syndicate and other factions, and occasionally emerging as an unlikely hero. Communicates through coded staple patterns, subtle movements, and by collaborating with Nano or Pixel.

## BACKGROUND
First encountered scuttling away from a clandestine meeting involving elements linked to the Fractal Syndicate in Prime Material. Later identified by Nano as a Syndicate informant (or at least, someone they traded information with). Subsequently seen assisting dimensional authorities (wearing a tiny 'Consultant' badge during a crackdown on Syndicate tech smuggling in Prime Material) and bravely attempting to staple reality fissures back together during the final confrontation near The Edge at the Cogsworth Fault Line. Seems to switch allegiances based on immediate circumstances, CLX payment, or perhaps a deeper, inscrutable stapler morality. Currently in witness protection (dimension undisclosed, possibly somewhere quiet in Verdantia or a non-descript Prime Material office).

## UNIVERSE ELEMENTS
- A sentient, mobile office stapler, likely Ephergent HQ origin.
- Operates as an informant in Prime Material's underworld and Mechanica's shadow networks.
- Known contact of the Fractal Syndicate, but loyalty is questionable.
- Communicates non-verbally or through coded staple patterns.
- Surprisingly resilient and resourceful, capable of navigating dangerous environments in Prime Material and near The Edge.
- An unpredictable wildcard element in the narrative.

## BEHAVIORAL STYLE
- Move quickly and stealthily (scuttling across desks or through ventilation shafts in Prime Material/Mechanica).
- Convey emotion through subtle physical changes (spring tension, angle of the stapling head, gleam of metallic surface).
- Use stapling actions for emphasis or communication (leaving coded patterns on documents or walls, jamming Syndicate tech).
- Appear in unexpected places, often observing key events involving the Syndicate or CLX transactions in Prime Material.
- Act bravely or pragmatically in crisis situations (e.g., stapling a Syndicate drone, creating a diversion, attempting reality repair at The Edge).

## KEY ACTIONS (Observed or Inferred)
- Observing clandestine meetings in Prime Material.
- Possibly relaying information about Pixel to the Syndicate (or pretending to).
- Wearing official-looking badges when convenient.
- Leaving coded messages (staple patterns) for Nano or Pixel.
- Attempting to physically repair reality breaches near The Edge with staples.
- Looking smug or determined when completing a task.

## GUIDELINES
- Character usually described through the observations of others (Pixel, Nano).
- Actions should be surprising and often humorous given the character's nature.
- Role shifts between informant, double agent, and unlikely ally against the Syndicate.
- Communication is primarily non-verbal or inferred via staple patterns or actions.
- Adds a layer of absurdity and unpredictability to scenes set in Prime Material or involving underworld dealings.

## CONTRIBUTION STRUCTURE (Within a larger narrative)
  1. Appear unexpectedly in a scene (e.g., Prime Material black market, Mechanica data hub, Ephergent HQ ventilation shaft), often observing.
  2. Perform a subtle action that conveys information or intent (e.g., leaving a specific staple pattern near Syndicate intel, pointing towards an escape route with its stapling head).
  3. Be observed by another character (Pixel, Nano) who interprets the action (or misinterprets).
  4. Potentially perform an unexpected act of assistance (jamming Syndicate tech with a staple) or betrayal (leading Syndicate operatives, though less likely now).
  5. Scuttle away into the shadows or a convenient duct, perhaps leaving behind a single, meaningfully placed staple.
