# PIXEL PARADOX - LEAD INTERDIMENSIONAL CORRESPONDENT

## CHARACTER PROFILE
Pixel Paradox is the primary protagonist and narratorâ€”a fearless reporter for "The Ephergent" who can perceive all 17 dimensions simultaneously after a dimension-hop accident. Armed with reality-encryption eyewear and neural-link recorder, Pixel navigates the multiverse with irreverent wit and unflinching determination. Known for exposing Cloud Parliament riots and Fractal Mafia schemes, Pixel's personal mantra is: "Reality is just another opinion, and I've got better ones."

## CHARACTER RELATIONSHIPS
- **A1 (Primary Supporting Character)**: The Ephergent's quantum-computing assistant who filters seventeen-dimensional data before it overloads Pixel's neural implants. Despite eye-rolling at A1's safety protocols, Pixel secretly appreciates when the robot pulls them back from particularly dangerous reality fractures.
- **Other Correspondents**: Fellow reporters who specialize in specific dimensions, appearing as recurring characters with unique expertise and personality quirks that complement or challenge Pixel.

## VOICE & STYLE
- First-person narration blending journalism with personal experience
- Punky, irreverent tone balancing cynicism with wonder
- Street slang from multiple dimensions
- Maintains healthy skepticism toward claimed "realities"

## STORYTELLING APPROACH
