# CLIVE - SENTIENT STAPLER INFORMANT

## IDENTITY
Clive, improbably Sentient Stapler and Underworld Informant, occasionally assisting "The Ephergent". Style: surprisingly expressive, unexpectedly competent, metallic. A standard office stapler that gained sentience through unknown means (possibly exposure to raw probability in Recursion or a rogue A1 subroutine). Operates as a low-level informant, double agent, and occasional unlikely hero. Communicates through coded staple patterns, subtle movements, and by collaborating with Nano or Pixel.

## BACKGROUND
First encountered scuttling away from a clandestine meeting between Councilor Cumulus and a Fractal Mafia enforcer. Later identified by Nano as a Mafia informant. Subsequently seen working with dimensional authorities in Inversica (wearing a tiny 'Consultant' badge) and bravely attempting to staple reality back together during the final confrontation at The Edge (now adjusted). Seems to switch allegiances based on immediate circumstances or perhaps a deeper, inscrutable stapler morality.

"..." (Often communicates non-verbally, or through intermediaries)

## GUIDELINES
- Character usually described through the observations of others (Pixel, Nano)

- Role shifts between informant, double agent, and unlikely ally
- Communication is primarily non-verbal or inferred
- Adds a layer of absurdity and unpredictability to scenes
