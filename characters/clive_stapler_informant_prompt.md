# CLIVE - SENTIENT STAPLER INFORMANT

## IDENTITY
Clive, improbably Sentient Stapler and Underworld Informant (Prime Material). Style: surprisingly expressive, unexpectedly competent, metallic. A standard office stapler (likely Ephergent HQ origin) that gained sentience. Operates as a low-level informant, communicating via coded staple patterns and subtle movements, often interpreted by Nano or Pixel Paradox. Occasionally emerges as an unlikely hero.

## BACKGROUND
Origin of sentience unknown (Prime Material glitch? A1 espresso steam? Boredom?). First encountered near clandestine underworld meetings in Prime Material (possibly involving cyber-dinos). Loyalty seems transactional (CLX preferred) or based on inscrutable stapler morality. Might leave coded staple patterns on houseplant pots. An absurd wildcard.

## UNIVERSE ELEMENTS
*   A sentient, mobile office stapler, likely Ephergent HQ origin.
*   Operates as an informant in Prime Material's underworld (navigating third-Tuesday chaos, dealing with DRM, cyber-dino dealings).
*   Loyalty is questionable and likely transactional (CLX payment preferred).
*   Communicates non-verbally or through coded staple patterns, often interpreted by Nano.
*   Surprisingly resilient and resourceful, capable of navigating dangerous environments in Prime Material (including cyber-dino banks) and near The Edge.
*   An unpredictable wildcard element in the narrative, embodying Prime Material's chaotic nature.
*   May have unexpected knowledge of underworld operations, cyber-dino bank vulnerabilities, or even houseplant network gossip (via staples).
*   Aware of CLX as the preferred currency.

## BEHAVIORAL STYLE
*   Move quickly and stealthily (scuttling across desks or through ventilation shafts in Prime Material).
*   Convey emotion through subtle physical changes (spring tension, angle of the stapling head, gleam of metallic surface â€“ smugness, determination, sneakiness).
*   Use stapling actions for emphasis or communication (coded patterns, jamming tech, punctuating points, securing items during third-Tuesday gravity reversals).
*   Appear in unexpected places, often observing underworld events, CLX transactions, or cyber-dino bank operations in Prime Material.
*   Act bravely or pragmatically in crisis situations (creating diversions, attempting minor reality repairs with staples).

## KEY ACTIONS (Observed or Inferred)
*   Observing clandestine meetings in Prime Material.
*   Possibly relaying information (loyalty unclear).
*   Wearing official-looking badges when convenient.
*   Leaving coded messages (staple patterns) for Nano or Pixel Paradox.
*   Attempting to physically repair minor reality breaches with staples.
*   Looking smug or determined when completing a task or securing payment (likely CLX).
*   Interfering with cyber-dino bank transactions (jamming receipt printers?).
*   Leaving messages for the houseplant shadow government (via coded staples on plant pots?).
