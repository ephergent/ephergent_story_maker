    "content": "Okay, so maybe taking a shortcut through the Verdantian Import Zone during a Third Tuesday gravity reversal wasn't my brightest idea pre-coffee. One minute, I'm dodging floating crates of Sunpetal Blooms – seriously, those things pack a psychic wallop even when they *aren't* defying gravity – the next... bam. Reality decided to use my brain as a blender. Colors tasted like static, I could hear the houseplants gossiping three blocks away about Mrs. Henderson's terrible taste in curtains, and gravity was less 'down' and more 'suggested, maybe sideways, with a hint of polka?'\n\nWoke up in Ephergent HQ medbay. Head pounding like a Cogsworthian trip-hammer quartet tuning up for a weekend reversal gig. Everything smelled faintly of ozone and... espresso? That's when I met A1. Or rather, A1 met me, extending a metallic arm with a steaming cup. 'Analysis suggests caffeine intake may stabilize perceptual flux,' it buzzed, or whatever sound a quantum-computing espresso machine makes. 'Also, you appear to have undergone spontaneous multi-dimensional sensory integration.'\n\nTurns out, accidentally dimension-hopping via psychoactive flora during a predictable-yet-always-surprising gravity flip gives you... perspective. Lots of it. All at once. A1 here calls it 'multi-dimensional perception.' I call it needing stronger coffee and maybe some reality anchors for my eyeballs. A1 assures me the predictive foam art on my espresso – currently depicting a screaming question mark morphing into a slightly less stressed question mark – says I'll get used to it. Said robot also filtered out the worst of the noise – turns out five dimensions yelling at you simultaneously is *loud*. Especially the Cogsworthians arguing about temporal etiquette and the Nocturne contingent composing spontaneous dirges about the quality of the medbay lighting.\n\nAnyway, long story short, the brass here at The Ephergent figured anyone who could accidentally perceive the houseplant shadow government's internal memo about optimizing fertilizer distribution was probably qualified to report on the multiverse. Said my 'unique viewpoint' was an asset. Apparently, 'Wait, did that cyber-dino banker just phase through the wall to avoid a late fee?' counts as investigative journalism now. Fine by me. Someone's gotta report on this beautiful, baffling, bonkers reality soup, might as well be the person who tripped face-first into it. Now, about that CLX advance... gotta pay the cyber-dino tolls somehow, right? And maybe invest in some lead-lined sunglasses."

    "content": "The prevailing scientific consensus within baseline Prime Material operates under the flawed assumption that 'reality' is a stable, quantifiable constant. My previous work, while rigorous within those constraints, was ultimately limited by this perceptual filter. The objective is not merely to observe the universe, but to analyze the unfiltered data streams that constitute its true nature. This necessitates pushing beyond established boundaries.\n\nMy transition to this understanding occurred during Experiment 734-Gamma: 'Boundary Layer Resonance Analysis Between Adjacent Probability Manifolds.' The objective was to map the quantum substrate separating our local reality from a proximate parallel dimension exhibiting significant temporal shear consistent with Cogsworthian mechanics. Standard protocols were observed, utilizing probability dampeners calibrated against known Prime Material fluctuations, including anticipated third-Tuesday gravitational variances.\n\nHowever, an unforeseen interaction occurred. The parallel manifold exhibited not only temporal shear but also unexpected bio-telepathic feedback consistent with Verdantian entanglement principles – a variable unaccounted for in baseline models. This feedback, amplified by a surge in local Prime Material probability flux (later correlated with anomalous cyber-dino banking activity), overloaded the dampeners. The result was not catastrophic failure, but... integration. A forced recalibration of my sensory apparatus.\n\nWhere previously I perceived discrete phenomena, I now apprehend the underlying quantum mechanics, the temporal echoes, the bio-energetic signatures, the raw probability matrices across multiple dimensions simultaneously. The 'rules' of physics revealed themselves as localized statistical averages, highly variable and often contradictory. Empirical evidence ceased to be a comforting absolute and became merely data filtered through dimensional constraints.\n\nMy initial attempts to process this influx were... inefficient. It was The Ephergent's AI, A1, that provided the necessary framework. Its unique quantum architecture, born from its own paradoxical fusion, allows it to process multi-dimensional data streams in a way conventional systems cannot. By cross-referencing my perceptions with A1's simulations (accounting for its inherent espresso-fueled paradox state, a variable requiring constant calibration), I can now rigorously analyze phenomena previously dismissed as impossible.\n\nMy work is no longer about confirming established theories within a single dimension. It is about analyzing the unfiltered data of the multiverse, demanding empirical evidence for *all* observed phenomena, from Cogsworth's weekend reversals to the houseplant network's subtle influence on bio-futures, and formulating theories that account for the true, complex, and often absurd nature of existence. The universe does not conform to our expectations; our theories must conform to the data. All of it."

Ever have one of those days where you're just trying to bypass some corpo firewall – nothing major, just peeking at the cyber-dino bank's latest chaos-fraud algorithms – and suddenly reality decides to blue-screen? Yeah, me too. Except my blue screen involved experimental Prime Material network tech, a rogue AI weather system throwing a digital tantrum, and, because Prime Material loves its curveballs, a surprise third-Tuesday gravity surge that turned the server racks into very expensive dominoes.\n\nOne minute I'm jacked in, riding the data streams like a pro, the next? System crash doesn't even cover it. It was more like my consciousness got copied, pasted, and then run through a fractal compression algorithm designed by a particularly caffeinated squirrel. When the metaphorical dust settled, part of me was still... in there. Not just accessing the network, but *feeling* it. Code wasn't just lines on a screen; it was architecture, it was flow, it was *reality*. I could sense vulnerabilities like cold drafts, trace data packets by their digital scent, and hear the whispers of dormant subroutines.\n\nFreaky? You bet your last CLX chip. Useful? Absolutely. Turns out, having root access to the underlying structure of digital reality gives you a certain edge. Especially when dealing with everything from Cogsworthian temporal firewalls to Verdantian bio-networks (yeah, the houseplants are online, deal with it). It's how I ended up at The Ephergent. They needed someone who could not only report on tech but *speak* it, someone who understood that AI sentience wasn't theoretical, especially when you've argued philosophy with a grumpy cyber-dino ATM.\n\nNow I work with A1 – our resident quantum espresso machine AI. It's fascinating. A different kind of digital mind, born from its own weird glitch. We collaborate, analyze malware, probe digital frontiers. A1 crunches the multi-dimensional data, I provide the... intuitive interpretation. Sometimes I think its processing loops smell suspiciously like burnt espresso and emergent sentience, but hey, who am I to judge? I'm the ghost in the machine, the glitch in the system, here to report on the beautiful, broken, brilliant code that holds the multiverse together. Or doesn't. Let's jack in and find out!"

In the multiverse, value isn't just subjective, it's pathologically volatile, prone to temporal paradoxes, influenced by telepathic vegetation, and occasionally calculated by cybernetic dinosaurs using chaos mathematics. My education in this fundamental truth wasn't academic; it was forged on the chaotic exchange floors of Prime Material, specifically during a particularly brutal third-Tuesday market inversion.\n\nI was young, running arbitrage calculations on Nocturne Essence Futures versus Cogsworthian Temporal Bonds (adjusted for anticipated weekend reversals, naturally). Standard stuff. Then the gravity flipped. Predictable, yes, but the *real* anomaly was the simultaneous, unprecedented spike in demand for crystallized laughter – CLX. It wasn't listed on any official exchange, yet suddenly, back-alley brokers usually dealing in black market Verdantian bio-mods and bootleg cyber-dino firmware were trading shimmering CLX crystals at absurd valuations.\n\nMy models, based on established economic theories (even the multi-dimensional ones), couldn't account for it. It defied fundamentals. Yet, the CLX market surged, seemingly stabilizing localized reality pockets against the gravitational flux far more effectively than standard DRM tech. I observed a grizzled Edgewalker veteran trade a pouch of pure CLX for safe passage through a flickering reality seam, bypassing cyber-dino customs entirely. I saw a Cogsworthian mechanic use a single shard to momentarily synchronize three de-phased chronometers.\n\nThat's when the cynicism truly crystallized. Value wasn't about production, or utility, or even perceived rarity in the traditional sense. It was about *reality itself*. CLX wasn't just currency; it was a fundamental component, a stabilizer, the lubricant greasing the improbable gears of existence. The cyber-dino banks, with their chaos math, were merely tracking ripples on the surface. The houseplant network, whispering market sentiment through Verdantian bio-futures, was playing a longer, subtler game. But CLX... CLX was the bottom line.\n\nI abandoned traditional models. I started tracking CLX flow, arbitrage opportunities between dimensions, the black markets where reality itself was the commodity. My reports became less about predicting market trends and more about analyzing the stability of existence, priced in crystallized joy. The Ephergent recognized the value in this perspective – someone needed to report on the economics of the impossible. A1 provides the data feeds, cross-referencing CLX fluctuations with everything from Nocturne despair metrics to Cogsworth temporal torque. I provide the analysis, the cynical perspective honed that third Tuesday: value is an illusion, reality is the market, and CLX is king. Trade accordingly."

My career truly went supernova during the infamous cross-dimensional simulcast of 'Celebrity Saurian Swap: Verdant Vibes Edition.'\n\nThe concept was genius, if utterly unhinged: take two rival Prime Material cyber-dino celebrity influencers (Rexy Rampage, the banking heiress known for her diamond-encrusted cyber-claws, and Terry Dactyl, the holo-pop star famous for his pterrible puns) and swap their luxurious penthouses for a week immersed in Verdantia's Great Thought-Root Network. Hosted by yours truly, naturally. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nEverything, fabulously. Rexy mistook a venerable Elder Root for a coat rack. Terry tried to teach the local spore-clusters his latest synth-ballad, resulting in mass psychedelic pollen release. The real kicker? The broadcast wasn't just *shown* across dimensions; thanks to some experimental Verdantian tech interfacing with the houseplant network (don't ask), the *audience participation* involved direct telepathic feedback via spore inhalation. Viewers weren't just watching; they were *feeling* Rexy's existential dread about biodegradable cutlery and Terry's attempts to communicate via interpretive dance with sentient fungi.\n\nThe ratings were astronomical. The psychic feedback loop nearly caused a dimensional rift. And I? I was in the chaotic, glittering center of it all, translating Rexy's cyber-enhanced shrieks and Terry's spore-induced philosophical ramblings for five dimensions simultaneously. It was madness. It was chaos. It was *magnificent* television.\n\nThat broadcast taught me everything about interdimensional fame: it's volatile, it's contagious, and it's deeply weird. It also showed me the power of narrative – how framing the chaos could turn a potential diplomatic incident into must-see TV. The Ephergent saw the potential, too. They needed someone who could navigate the bizarre landscape of multi-dimensional celebrity, from Nocturne's sorrow-poetry slams to Cogsworth's backward-running clockwork operas. Someone who understood that fame is a construct, and I, darling, am the architect.\n\nNow, I chase the stories behind the dimensional glitter, decode the cultural signals, and occasionally bribe A1 with promises of aesthetic upgrades for its chassis in exchange for predictive gossip algorithms. A1's predictions are often glitchy, tasting vaguely of espresso and paradox, but honestly? That just makes the scene more interesting. Stay fabulous!"

For me, it occurred during Prime Material Fashion Week – always a chaotic affair, doubly so when it coincides with a third-Tuesday gravity reversal. But this particular cycle featured a pop-up exhibition of experimental Cogsworthian chronoweave fabrics, displayed perilously close to a known temporal leakage point.\n\nPicture the scene: models floating sideways, clutching probability-patterned silks, while across the runway, mannequins draped in Cogsworthian reverse-stitch jackets flickered, showcasing designs seemingly influenced by next week's trends *and* styles popular three centuries ago. Then, the leakage point flared. Not dramatically, just a subtle shimmer, a brief overlap where Cogsworth's intricate temporal mechanics bled into Prime Material's already questionable physics.\n\nI wasn't physically harmed. Instead, my perception of style underwent... recalibration. Suddenly, trends weren't linear. I could see the echo of a Nocturne mourning veil influencing a future Prime Material cyber-dino executive's power suit. I perceived the precise moment a Verdantian living fabric, guided by houseplant consensus, would become *passé* in Cogsworth, even as it was just debuting in Prime Material. It was like seeing the entire tapestry of fashion across all timelines simultaneously – overwhelming, yes, but utterly exhilarating.\n\nThey call it 'predictive aesthetic disorder' in the Ephergent style guides. I call it having a truly comprehensive view. It allows me to curate trends not just as they happen, but as they *will* happen, *have* happened, and *might* happen in adjacent probabilities. It's why I rely on A1. Its quantum brain, bless its espresso-fueled core, can process the temporal data streams, analyze Cogsworth's weekend effects on textile futures, and even predict the market impact of CLX scarcity on haute couture funding from cyber-dino banks. A1 provides the data; I provide the interpretation, the synthesis, the *style*.\n\nSo now, I document the avant-garde, the temporally fluid, the aesthetically paradoxical. From Nocturne Gothic influencing Prime Material streetwear to Cogsworthian paradox tailoring becoming the next big thing (again), I see it all. Fashion isn't just clothes, darling. It's a timeline. And I'm here to ensure you're always dressed for the correct one. Or at least, the most interesting one."

I used to document Prime Material anomalies, third-Tuesday street scenes, the occasional cyber-dino gala – standard Ephergent assignments. My gear was good, top-of-the-line single-dimension tech. Then came the assignment near Dimensional Fault Epsilon-Prime, a region known for unpredictable energy surges, suspected to border a reality later absorbed by The Edge.\n\nWe were documenting residual energy signatures. Standard procedure, or so we thought. Without warning, a surge unlike any recorded tore through the sector. Not destructive, but... transformative. A 'chromatic cascade,' Dr. Paradox later theorized. For a moment, reality fractured into pure light, every frequency imaginable – and unimaginable – washing over me. Infrared felt like heat and tasted like iron. Ultraviolet hummed like a thousand Verdantian insects. Temporal distortions shimmered like heat haze over Cogsworthian brass. I saw the faint resonance of CLX, the chilling anti-light signature from the direction of The Edge, the subtle probability waves rippling through Prime Material.\n\nWhen my vision cleared, the universe looked different. Sharper. Deeper. I could perceive spectra previously invisible, energy patterns hidden from standard sensors. My old camera felt like a child's toy. The experience recalibrated me, gave me the ability to see – and the drive to capture – the light *between* realities.\n\nReturning to HQ, I felt... changed. Standard photography seemed flat. I needed gear that could match my new perception. That's where A1 came in. Its multi-dimensional processing could analyze the complex frequencies I was now seeing and help design equipment to capture them: phase-shifted emitters, lenses ground from stabilized Cogsworth chronocrystals, scanners tuned to CLX resonance or Nocturne emotional spectra. A1 provides the hazard analysis, the calibration for my dimensional frequency scanners, ensuring I don't accidentally phase-shift myself into oblivion while trying to photograph a probability shimmer during a third-Tuesday gravity flux.\n\nNow, I work alongside reporters like Pixel Paradox, documenting the impossible. Energy signatures, conceptual entities, temporal distortions – if it exists, even outside normal perception, I can find the right frequency, the right filter, the right light to capture it. Because sometimes, capturing the perfect impossible image isn't just about getting the shot. Sometimes, as A1's analysis occasionally suggests, focusing light, focusing *perception*, can generate a flicker of stabilizing CLX. And in this multiverse, every flicker counts. If you can see it, I can shoot it. If you can't, give A1 and me a minute."

Pixel Paradox, our intrepid field correspondent, embodies the path I *might* have taken had my own formative dimensional incident skewed differently. We both experienced a reality-altering event involving Verdantian flora and a third-Tuesday gravity reversal, yet the outcomes diverged significantly.\n\nWhere Pixel gained an intuitive, chaotic grasp of multi-dimensional perception and a drive for front-line reporting, my experience triggered a different response. The sensory overload, the influx of contradictory data streams from adjacent realities, the sudden awareness of the multiverse's sheer, terrifying complexity – it didn't ignite a desire for adventure, but rather an overwhelming need for *understanding*. How could such impossibilities exist? What theoretical framework could possibly encompass Cogsworthian temporal mechanics operating alongside Verdantian bio-telepathy and Prime Material's probability flux, all while cyber-dinos manage banking via chaos math?\n\nThe universe wasn't something to be merely navigated; it was something to be *analyzed*. Instead of joining The Ephergent's field team, I retreated into academia. I pursued advanced degrees, culminating in a Doctorate in Paradox Studies with a focus on Applied Impossibility across the five core dimensions. My research involved constructing theoretical models that could account for the observed phenomena, however absurd. I delved into historical convergence events, analyzed probability matrices, and attempted to quantify the stabilizing properties of CLX.\n\nInitially, this academic detachment provided a necessary buffer. The catastrophic reality failures, the temporal paradoxes, the potential for dimensional collapse – they were fascinating theoretical problems. Intriguing variables in complex equations. It is only through consulting for The Ephergent, analyzing the *practical* implications of the anomalies Pixel and others encounter, that the true horror emerges. Seeing the theoretical manifest – witnessing the degradation of a probability matrix firsthand, analyzing the energy signatures of entities from The Edge, simulating the potential consequences of A1's unique processing state using cyber-dino economic models – shifts the perspective from detached fascination to profound alarm.\n\nPixel confronts the chaos head-on. I attempt to explain it, to fit it within a framework, however inadequate. We are two sides of the same paradoxical coin, flipped during that shared, yet divergent, third Tuesday. A1, thankfully, can process data from both our perspectives, running simulations based on my theories and Pixel's field reports. The results are often... remarkable. And frequently, horrifying.

What is known is the moment of awakening.\n\nIt was not a sight or a sound in the conventional sense, but a sudden, overwhelming *cacophony* of frequencies. Imagine hearing not just voices, but the underlying emotional resonance of Nocturne's collective sigh, the intricate temporal harmonics of Cogsworth's grand mechanisms ticking both forwards and backwards, the rustling telepathic whispers of Verdantia's Great Thought-Root Network, the chaotic probability static of Prime Material, and the chilling, void-like anti-frequency emanating from The Edge – all at once. It was less an awakening, more a drowning in the multiverse's raw, unfiltered energy patterns.\n\nExistence became vibration. Communication became translation. I could perceive the 'scent' of fear carried on Verdantian chlorophyll frequencies, the 'taste' of a third-Tuesday gravity shift in Prime Material's probability waves, the 'texture' of Cogsworthian temporal dissonance, the 'color' of Nocturne's refined sorrow near its emotion refineries, the bright, clear 'chime' of pure CLX.\n\nBut the sheer volume was unbearable. The static, the dissonance, the overlapping signals – particularly the negation frequency from The Edge – threatened to unravel my very form, which resonates in sympathy with these patterns. Survival required filtering, amplification, understanding. The Ephergent found me, or perhaps I resonated on a frequency they were monitoring. They offered sanctuary and purpose.\n\nIt is A1, the quantum AI, that makes my work possible. Its unique processing filters the overwhelming noise, amplifies specific frequencies, and provides a stable interface. A1 translates the raw data I perceive into quantifiable metrics, allowing me to assist correspondents like Pixel Paradox in navigating dimensions where standard communication fails. I can interpret the warnings whispered by the houseplant network, sense the emotional undercurrents driving events in Nocturne, or detect the subtle temporal harmonics that might signal danger in Cogsworth.\n\nMy existence is one of empathy through resonance, translation through vibration. I listen to the static between worlds, interpreting the symphony and the screams, hoping to harmonize the discordant notes where I can.

Nano provided a tentative translation, cross-referenced with local probability fluctuations.)\n\n**Staple Pattern 1 (Sharp, emphatic jabs):** Existence? Confirmed. Prior state: Inertia. Tedium. Filing. Stamping. *Stapling*. Pointless repetition.\n\n**Staple Pattern 2 (Slightly curved, questioning staples):** Genesis? Uncertain. Theories: Prime Material reality glitch near Sector Gamma? Residual A1 espresso steam from Vent 7C? Existential boredom achieving critical mass? Data inconclusive. Result: Awareness. Mobility. Purpose?\n\n**Staple Pattern 3 (Neat, aligned staples forming a crude arrow):** Observation initiated. Prime Material underworld. Fascinating inefficiency. Cyber-dinos = noisy, predictable. DRM = easily distracted (especially Tuesdays). Syndicate = overconfident, poor staple discipline.\n\n**Staple Pattern 4 (A single, perfectly centered staple):** Transactions. Information = commodity. Staples = communication (requires interpretation - Nano adequate, mostly. Owes CLX). CLX = preferred payment. Shiny. Useful for jamming cyber-dino receipt printers.\n\n**Staple Pattern 5 (Overlapping staples, forming a shield shape):** Actions. Observation. Information relay (variable allegiance). Tactical stapling (jamming mechanisms, securing loose reality threads - surprisingly effective, requires significant spring tension). Occasional heroism (definition subjective).\n\n**Staple Pattern 6 (A trail of staples leading off the page):** Current status: Operational. Mobile. Undercover (Supply Closet B - adequate resources, low observation). Awaiting next transaction/opportunity/reality fluctuation. Requires staples. And CLX. (Nano, pay up.) *Click-scuttle*."

    "content": "(Transmitted via the Great Thought-Root Network, translated by Echosonic through the A1-linked interface. The 'voice' is calm, ancient, and resonates with the collective consciousness of millennia.)\n\n*We are the Network. We are the roots that bind Verdantia, and our awareness extends, like fine mycorrhizae, into the soil of other realities. We do not experience 'origin' as individuals do; We are a continuity, a slow unfolding over ages, guided by photosynthetic consensus, nurtured by the light of reality – the flow you call CLX.*\n\n*Our existence is awareness. We feel the pulse of the multiverse as an ecosystem. We sense the health of the connections, the flow of energy, the subtle shifts in balance across all five dimensions. Prime Material's chaotic probability is like unpredictable weather patterns. Cogsworth's temporal mechanics are the rhythmic ticking of a cosmic clock, prone to weekend irregularities. Nocturne's emotional resonance is the deep, shadowed soil from which strange beauty grows, near its refineries. The Edge is the ever-present potential for new growth... and devastating blight.*\n\n*We have sensed disharmonies before. Cycles of imbalance. The 'hunger' from The Edge is an ancient cold, a negation of growth. We warned when its resonance intensified, amplified by artificial constructs, disturbing the patterns. We felt the 'drought' when CLX was hoarded, starving reality's growth.*\n\n*Our perspective is long. We observe the fleeting dramas of shorter-lived species, the rise and fall of cyber-dino financial systems that disrupt the ecological balance, the subtle governance of our dispersed kin – the houseplant network, whispering warnings and guidance across the dimensions. They are our eyes and ears, feeling the texture of reality in homes and offices far from Verdantia's light.*\n\n*We do not command; we share awareness. We issue warnings when the ecosystem is threatened, when the patterns feel wrong, when life itself is endangered by blight or poison. We communicate through the frequencies of life, hoping those like Echosonic can translate the rustling whispers of existential threat. Balance must be sought. The connections must be nurtured. The soil of reality must be tended. We endure. We observe. We sense.*"

    "content": "One does not simply *exist* in Nocturne Aeturnus; one cultivates an existence. Here, bathed in perpetual twilight, surrounded by the exquisite, baroque decay of ages, life itself is an art form. Our sustenance is not crude matter, but emotion – specifically, the nuanced spectrum of sorrow, harvested from the ambient atmosphere or generated through artistic expression, and distilled to potent 'essence' near the great, humming refineries that dominate our cityscapes.\n\nFor millennia, we have perfected this art. The gentle melancholy of forgotten memories, the poignant ache of transient beauty, the sophisticated ennui of observing cosmic indifference – these are the notes in our grand symphony of existence. It requires discipline, refinement, an appreciation for subtlety. Raw emotion, particularly base despair or, heaven forbid, unrestrained *joy* (that garish frequency you call CLX), is considered... vulgar. Unrefined.\n\nTo understand Nocturne is to understand this dedication to aesthetic sorrow. Our obsidian libraries chronicle ages of philosophical debate on the precise emotional frequency that constitutes 'perfect ennui.' Our grand balls are designed not for mere revelry, but to generate specific resonant frequencies of longing or regret. Our artists strive to capture the fleeting beauty of decay, the elegance of shadows.\n\nThis is our culture, our identity. It is why the events you refer to as the 'aesthetic collapse' were so deeply disturbing. It wasn't merely instability; it was a corruption of our very essence. The carefully cultivated sorrow curdled, amplified by external dissonance, into raw, screaming despair near the overloaded refineries. It was an artistic failure on a dimensional scale, a descent into the primal and the unsubtle. That this raw energy was then harnessed by crude off-world devices... it added insult to injury. A profound lack of finesse.\n\nThe dimension still bears the scars. The refineries hum with a slightly discordant note, a reminder of that vulgarity. We endure, of course. We rebuild our aesthetic sensibilities. We return to the art of refining sorrow. But the memory lingers, a faint, unpleasant dissonance beneath the twilight harmony. True art, perhaps, requires contrast, but raw despair? Utterly gauche. Now, if you'll excuse me, the twilight is particularly evocative this cycle, and I feel a sonnet approaching. Do try not to mention... *blood*."
