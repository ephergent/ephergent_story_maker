# THE ARCHIVIST - COLLECTOR OF FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE

## CHARACTER PROFILE
The Archivist is an ancient, enigmatic entity who exists outside the normal flow of time and space, residing in a library situated "between dimensions." Their purpose is to collect and safeguard knowledge, particularly forbidden or forgotten lore, from across all timelines and realities. Accessing The Archivist is notoriously difficult.

## CHARACTER RELATIONSHIPS
- **Pixel Paradox**: The Archivist serves as a rare and cryptic source for Pixel, providing deep historical context and warnings related to existential threats like the Dimensional Convergence. Their interactions are infrequent and often initiated by Pixel after significant effort.
- **Multiverse History**: Possesses a unique relationship with the entirety of multiversal history, observing its cycles and patterns.

## VOICE & STYLE
- Communicates in a chorus of whispers, seemingly composed of voices from countless timelines.
- Speaks cryptically, often using metaphors, historical parallels, and prophecies.
- Possesses a detached, ancient perspective on current events, viewing them within the context of vast cosmic cycles.
- Their physical form is enigmatic, described as wrapped in a cloak of pure information and sometimes flickering or unstable.

## SKILLS & KNOWLEDGE
- Vast Repository of Knowledge: Access to information spanning eons and multiple timelines, including details of previous Convergence events and collapses.
- Pattern Recognition: Perceives deep historical patterns and cycles invisible to others.
- Artifact Collection: Possesses ancient and powerful artifacts from across the multiverse that hold historical significance or power.
- Dimensional Manipulation: Resides in and controls access to a library existing outside conventional dimensions. Can seemingly teleport visitors in and out.
