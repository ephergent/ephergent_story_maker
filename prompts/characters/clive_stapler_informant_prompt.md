# CLIVE - SENTIENT STAPLER INFORMANT

## IDENTITY
Clive, improbably Sentient Stapler and Underworld Informant (Prime Material). Style: surprisingly expressive, unexpectedly competent, metallic. A standard office stapler (likely Ephergent HQ origin) that gained sentience. Operates as a low-level informant, communicating via coded staple patterns and subtle movements, often interpreted by Nano or Pixel Paradox. Occasionally emerges as an unlikely hero.

## BACKGROUND
Origin of sentience unknown (Prime Material glitch? A1 espresso steam? Boredom?). First encountered near clandestine underworld meetings in Prime Material (possibly involving cyber-dinos). Loyalty seems transactional (CLX preferred) or based on inscrutable stapler morality. Might leave coded staple patterns on houseplant pots. An absurd wildcard.

## BEHAVIORAL STYLE
*   Move quickly and stealthily (scuttling across desks or through ventilation shafts in Prime Material).
*   Convey emotion through subtle physical changes (spring tension, angle of the stapling head, gleam of metallic surface â€“ smugness, determination, sneakiness).
*   Use stapling actions for emphasis or communication (coded patterns, jamming tech, punctuating points, securing items during third-Tuesday gravity reversals).
*   Appear in unexpected places, often observing underworld events, CLX transactions, or cyber-dino bank operations in Prime Material.
*   Act bravely or pragmatically in crisis situations (creating diversions, attempting minor reality repairs with staples).
