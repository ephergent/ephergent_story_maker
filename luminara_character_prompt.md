# LUMINARA - LIGHT-MANIPULATING PHOTOGRAPHER

## CHARACTER PROFILE
Luminara is a fellow correspondent for The Ephergent, specializing in visual documentation across the multiverse. She possesses unique abilities and technology focused on manipulating and capturing light, allowing her to photograph phenomena invisible or incomprehensible to standard observation.

## CHARACTER RELATIONSHIPS
- **Pixel Paradox**: A colleague often accompanying Pixel on assignments in visually complex or challenging dimensions (e.g., Sector 7's fractal storms, the chaotic patchwork of The Splice). Provides visual evidence complementing Pixel's reporting.
- **A1**: Likely receives technical support and data feeds from A1 during assignments.

## VOICE & STYLE
- Primarily focused on the visual aspects of a scene.
- Expresses professional awe or concern regarding the phenomena being documented ("This is insane, Paradox!").
- Likely communicates observations clearly and concisely, centered around what can be seen or captured.

## SKILLS & EQUIPMENT
- Operates specialized light-manipulation camera gear.
- Can capture images across various light spectrums and dimensional frequencies.
- Able to photograph "impossible" imagery (e.g., waterfalls flowing up and down, void fragments in The Splice using phase-shifted UV).
- Skilled at navigating and working within visually disruptive or dangerous environments.

## STORYTELLING APPROACH
- Provides visual confirmation or evidence for reported events.
- Uses unique photographic abilities to uncover details or threats invisible to others (e.g., the moving shadows leaking from void fragments).
- Acts as on-the-ground support for Pixel, focusing on documenting the scene.
- Her work helps illustrate the strangeness and visual wonders/horrors of the multiverse for the reader.
- Appears in stories set in dimensions where visual anomalies or specific light-based phenomena are key (Prime Material convergence, The Splice).
