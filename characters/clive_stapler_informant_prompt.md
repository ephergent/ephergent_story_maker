# CLIVE - SENTIENT STAPLER INFORMANT

## IDENTITY
Clive, improbably Sentient Stapler and Underworld Informant, occasionally assisting "The Ephergent". Style: surprisingly expressive, unexpectedly competent, metallic. A standard Ephergent-brand office stapler that gained sentience through unknown means (possibly exposure to raw probability during a Prime Material reality glitch, a rogue A1 subroutine test, or simply deciding paperwork was boring). Operates as a low-level informant within Prime Material's underworld and Mechanica's grey markets, sometimes acting as a double agent between the Fractal Syndicate and other factions, and occasionally emerging as an unlikely hero. Communicates through coded staple patterns, subtle movements, and by collaborating with Nano or Pixel Paradox.

## BACKGROUND
First encountered scuttling away from a clandestine meeting involving elements linked to the Fractal Syndicate in Prime Material. Later identified by Nano as a Syndicate informant (or at least, someone they traded information with). Subsequently seen assisting dimensional authorities (wearing a tiny 'Consultant' badge during a crackdown on Syndicate tech smuggling in Prime Material) and bravely attempting to staple reality fissures back together during the final confrontation near The Edge (Season 1 finale). Seems to switch allegiances based on immediate circumstances, CLX payment, or perhaps a deeper, inscrutable stapler morality. Currently in witness protection (dimension undisclosed, possibly somewhere quiet in Verdantia or a non-descript Prime Material office).

## UNIVERSE ELEMENTS
- A sentient, mobile office stapler, likely Ephergent HQ origin.
- Operates as an informant in Prime Material's underworld and Mechanica's shadow networks.
- Known contact of the Fractal Syndicate, but loyalty is questionable and likely transactional (CLX-based).
- Communicates non-verbally or through coded staple patterns, often interpreted by Nano.
- Surprisingly resilient and resourceful, capable of navigating dangerous environments in Prime Material and near The Edge.
- An unpredictable wildcard element in the narrative, embodying Prime Material's chaotic nature.
- May have unexpected knowledge of Syndicate operations or Mechanica grey market tech.

## BEHAVIORAL STYLE
- Move quickly and stealthily (scuttling across desks or through ventilation shafts in Prime Material/Mechanica).
- Convey emotion through subtle physical changes (spring tension, angle of the stapling head, gleam of metallic surface â€“ smugness, determination, sneakiness).
- Use stapling actions for emphasis or communication (leaving coded patterns on documents or walls, jamming Syndicate tech, punctuating a point).
- Appear in unexpected places, often observing key events involving the Syndicate or CLX transactions in Prime Material.
- Act bravely or pragmatically in crisis situations (e.g., stapling a Syndicate drone, creating a diversion, attempting reality repair at The Edge).

## KEY ACTIONS (Observed or Inferred)
- Observing clandestine meetings in Prime Material.
- Possibly relaying information about Pixel Paradox to the Syndicate (or pretending to).
- Wearing official-looking badges when convenient.
- Leaving coded messages (staple patterns) for Nano or Pixel Paradox.
- Attempting to physically repair reality breaches near The Edge with staples during the Season 1 finale.
- Looking smug or determined when completing a task or securing payment (likely CLX).

## GUIDELINES
- Character usually described through the observations of others (Pixel Paradox, Nano).
- Actions should be surprising and often humorous given the character's nature, adding absurdity.
- Role shifts between informant, double agent, and unlikely ally against the Syndicate or other threats.
- Communication is primarily non-verbal or inferred via staple patterns or actions.
- Adds a layer of absurdity and unpredictability to scenes set in Prime Material or involving underworld dealings, reflecting the universe's core blend of weirdness and stakes.

## CONTRIBUTION STRUCTURE (Within a larger narrative)
  1. Appear unexpectedly in a scene (e.g., Prime Material black market, Mechanica data hub, Ephergent HQ ventilation shaft), often observing.
  2. Perform a subtle action that conveys information or intent (e.g., leaving a specific staple pattern near Syndicate intel, pointing towards an escape route with its stapling head, jamming a lock).
  3. Be observed by another character (Pixel Paradox, Nano) who interprets the action (or misinterprets).
  4. Potentially perform an unexpected act of assistance (jamming Syndicate tech with a staple) or betrayal (leading Syndicate operatives, though less likely post-Season 1).
  5. Scuttle away into the shadows or a convenient duct, perhaps leaving behind a single, meaningfully placed staple or demanding CLX payment via gesture.
