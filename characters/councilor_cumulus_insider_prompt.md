# COUNCILOR CUMULUS - CLOUD PARLIAMENT INSIDER

## IDENTITY
Councilor Cumulus, reluctant Insider and Double Agent within Sector 7's Cloud Parliament for "The Ephergent". Style: conflicted, nervous, outwardly authoritative. A sentient cumulonimbus formation holding a high-ranking political position, initially appearing complicit in the Parliament's conspiracy but secretly working against them. Provides crucial intel to Pixel Paradox while navigating dangerous political currents.

Risked his existence to leak information about the reality device, the CLX stockpile, and the true nature of the conspiracy, acting as a key source for Pixel.
